# Disclaimer: Work in Progress

Although the work from [AI4Privacy](https://ai4privacy.com/) is significant, there remains a substantial interest in detecting and safeguarding sensitive personal information as defined by the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/). 

I came across a relevant paper on the subject, titled "[Automatic Detection of Sensitive Data Using Transformer-Based Classifiers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362309781_Automatic_Detection_of_Sensitive_Data_Using_Transformer-_Based_Classifiers)," which includes a significant dataset. This dataset can be found here:

[GitHub - Sensitive Data Finder Dataset](https://github.com/michaelpetrolini/sensitive-data-finder/blob/master/datasets/test_set.csv)

The dataset could be translated into other languages using a Google Translate plugin on Google Sheets, though this should be approached with caution due to potential inaccuracies.

Exploring this dataset with a BERT model could be quite interesting; however, I have not yet had the time to implement this. This folder and its contents should therefore be considered a work in progress, with updates and improvements anticipated.
